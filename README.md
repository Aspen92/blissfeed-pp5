# Design

## Color Scheme

BILD

- I used a dark charcoal grey color (#212121) for the background to create a sleek and modern look for the page.

- I used a slightly lighter shade of grey (#323232) to define elements such as the navbar and other important sections of the page. This creates a clear contrast against the background.

- To add a clear and special color, I used two shades of teal (#0D7377) and #14FFEC for buttons. These colors went well with the grey background and help to draw attention to the buttons.

- For optimal readability, I used white for all text elements.

## Typography

- The main font used is called [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) and is a popular and versatile sans-serif typeface designed by Christian Robertson and released by Google in 2011.

- Sans-serif is used as a backup-font.

## Wireframes

Below are the wireframes originally sketched for both desktop and mobile versions of the page. The final version of the page closely resembled these mockups, with only a few elements being repositioned within the page.

# Frontend

## Developer Role

The primary responsibility of frontend developers is to develop the side of web applications that the user interacts with. This involves ensuring that users stay engaged on the site, requires expertise in areas such as responsiveness, accessibility, performance, interactivity, and design. While working alongside UX/UI and backend teams, frontend developers also need to have a sound understanding of backend structure to integrate it effectively with the frontend application.

## React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses a declarative approach to create reusable components, making it easier to build and maintain large-scale applications. Developed by Facebook, it has a large community.

## React-Bootstrap

React-Bootstrap is a popular front-end UI library that provides pre-built components for building responsive and mobile-first web applications using React. It is built on top of Bootstrap, which is a widely-used CSS framework.

# Agile

On this project I used GitHub to create an Kanban agile project management tool to create EPICs and add User Stories. Each user story was labeled with a "must-have", "should-have" or "could-have tag, and all user stories were completed during the project.

BILD

# Future Features Ideas / Improvements

- Add a way for users to message eachother.
- Add function for uploading videos.
- Make a light version of the application and make users have the choice of choosing between light or dark mode.
- Implement more testing for the application.
- Improve performance of the application.

The API is built specifically for this frontend application with the Django REST Framework. The repository for the backend can be found [here](https://github.com/Aspen92/blissfeed-drf-api).

## Bugs

- A bug related to categories in PostsPage.js - When entering the web application the "NoResults.png" was the first to show up. This was due to setHasLoaded was set to true. Here is the code with setHasLoaded commented out -

```//Fetch categories
  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchCategories = async () => {
      try {
        const { data } = await axiosReq.get(`/categories`);
        setCategories(data);
        // setHasLoaded(true);
      } catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
      }
    };

    fetchCategories();
  }, []);
```

# Credits

## Code

The React code for my BlissFeed project heavily relies on Code Institute's Moments walkthrough React project, which I found to have all the necessary features. However, I have incorporated my own custom styles and functionalities, such as a filtering system for categories, to meet the specific requirements of my project.
